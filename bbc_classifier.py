# Borthwick has much to ponder after a fourth straight loss to the Scots, which leaves England needing to win their remaining two matches to have any chance of competing for the Six Nations title. Smith's return will offer another playmaking option, while Mitchell is also thought to be making a quicker than expected recovery from a knee injury, although neither is ready to resume full training at this stage. Feyi-Waboso is pushing for a first international start after his try-scoring cameo against Scotland, but he will be absent from training all week as his medical exam is required to take place face-to-face.
